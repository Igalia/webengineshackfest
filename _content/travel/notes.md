-   **Usual timetables**. Lunch time: 13:00 - 15:30. Dinner time:
    20:30 - 22:30. Note that you won\'t be able to find a restaurant
    open for lunch at 12:00 or for dinner at 18:00, neither at 19:00;
    thus you might want to start your day a bit \"later\" than usual.
    Main reason behind this is that A CoruÃ±a is in the same timezone
    than central Europe, and [sunrise and sunset
    times](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/spain/la-coruna)
    are somehow shifted with regard to common standards in other parts
    of the world.
-   **Language**. The official languages in A CoruÃ±a are Galician and
    Spanish. Not everybody is able to understand or speak English (in
    the bus, taxi, hotel, etc). The Web Engines Hackfest is run in
    English.
-   **Climate**. A CoruÃ±a has a climate heavily moderated by the
    Atlantic Ocean. Average temperatures are around 10ÂºC (51ÂºF) in
    winter and 19ÂºC (66ÂºF) during summer. (See more info at
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Coru%C3%B1a#Climate)).
