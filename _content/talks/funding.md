The web is a vital source of the world’s infrastructure and has shaped the way we work and live in the modern world. Surely such an integral piece of our day-to-day life is being built and maintained in a way that ensures it will last?

In this talk, I’ll give an overview of the current state of things, how we currently fund the web, why this is a problem, and possible ways to fix this so that access to information remains stable and sustainable for future generations to come.
