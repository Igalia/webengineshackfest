A speedrun through recent and future changes around the two Linux-based WebKit ports.

We'll examine the current state of both Linux-based WebKit ports, covering recent and ongoing relevant changes inside the project as well as in the surrounding ecosystem. An examination of future architectural changes will be presented, along with proposals of baseline solutions and subsequent envisioned ramifications.
