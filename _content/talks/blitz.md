Blitz is new web rendering engine that doubles down on Servo's promise of modularity and hackability by combining a mix of Servo, Rust UI ecosystem, and bespoke components. It also (currently) eschews JavaScript scripting in favour of a Rust scripting API that can be driven directly by Dioxus or other Rust state management / reactivity frameworks.

This talk covers how Blitz's approach differs to a traditional web engine, use cases, challenges, progress, and future plans.
