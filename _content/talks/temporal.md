Join us for a story through our journey implementing TC39 proposals in SpiderMonkey, V8, and Boa.

We will examine how easy or difficult it is for new contributors to engage with each project, highlighting the challenges of navigating engine internals, what helped us get unstuck, and how we translated that experience into a community-focused tutorial. We will demonstrate the practical impact in implementing Upsert and discuss how Rust smoothed the onramp for contributing Temporal in Boa and V8.

We would like to thank Daniel Minor, Kevin Ness, and Philip Chimento for helping bring these projects to life.
