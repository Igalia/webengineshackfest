Servo is a web engine written in Rust. After parts of it were integrated into Mozilla Firefox, the project became independent but dormant in 2020. This year, with renewed interest in using it as a standalone embeddable engine, Servo is returning to active development.

This talk will go over the work we've done so far and our plans for the rest of 2023, particularly in Servoâ€™s layout system, as well as how you can help.
