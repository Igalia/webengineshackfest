AT Driver is a protocol for controlling assistive technology (AT) like screen readers. It's being developed as a component of the ARIA-AT project but with a much wider audience in mind.

In this talk, we'll explore the unique challenges of automating ATs, share the latest implementation status, review concurrent standards work that also surfaces the experience of AT users, and discuss the future of these efforts.
