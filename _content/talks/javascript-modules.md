For decades, JavaScript developers have relied on a multitude of module systems to organize and share code. But in 2015, ECMAScript finally introduced built-in standard semantics for modules, providing a long-awaited solution for the language. While ECMAScript modules have quickly become a popular format for writing code, most published code is still compiled to a single bundle or to a legacy module system.

The TC39 committee is actively exploring this design space: are there any missing functionalities compared to previous systems? Do JavaScript developers need any capabilities that the language does not currently provide? What problems do ECMAScript modules currently cause?
