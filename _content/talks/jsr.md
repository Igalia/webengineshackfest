The JavaScript Registry (JSR) is a modern alternative to npm—natively supported in pnpm, Yarn and Deno—yet still unsupported in npm and Node.js, leaving a gap in the module ecosystem and making it awkward for module authors.

This talk will go into how various aspects of JSR are architected, its capabilities and feature, how current tooling supports it, and how more can add support natively.
