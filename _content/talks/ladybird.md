Ladybird is a new browser (and engine) built completely from scratch. It was originally only usable on SerenityOS, but itâ€™s now expanded into its own cross-platform browser.

This talk will tell the story of Ladybird, starting from nothing in 2019, to where we are today, and share some of the challenges we've faced along the way.

I will also give an architectural overview of the engine.
